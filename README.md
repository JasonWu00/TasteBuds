## Description

TasteBuds is a web development project for the CSCI 499 capstone course at CUNY Hunter College. It consists of a React front-end website, a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon Web Services, and a Node.js backend that facilitates communication between the frontend and the database using Sequelize (which simulated SQL queries). The website displayed data from a dataset of recipes and offered culinary advice to users.

The development team for TasteBuds consists of four students, with me (user JasonWu00) being one of them. The full list of contributors can be found in the [original repo](https://github.com/csci-499-sp24/TasteBuds/tree/main). For my part of the project, I worked on creating the SQL connection between the frontend and the database. I wrote the Sequelize call framework that allowed the front-end website to read recipe data and display it to the user.
